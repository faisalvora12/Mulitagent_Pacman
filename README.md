# Mulitagent_Pacman
Making an AI multiagent for Pacman

Recreating the UC Berkeley CS188 Intro to AI: All rights for the projects goes to Berkeley. This was used for educational purpose as an AI class at Purdue University(CS471). 

Multi-Agent Search
Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. Students implement multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.
